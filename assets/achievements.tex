WebMGA 3.0 has successfully, and without any regressions, implemented a range of feature extensions and bugfixes to WebMGA 2.0. A larger range of useful molecule geometries are now available: the cut sphere, the spherical cap, the generic lens, the Cinacchi lens, and the biconvex lens.

Axes have been reimplemented to appear more clearly to the user, unobstructed by the molecular configuration, with an additional line now indicating the director and all lines coloured to indicate director alignment. 

New filetype support (CNF and Cinacchi format) has been included to allow directly loading configurations directly from real molecular simulation applications, reducing an obstacle to adoption by researchers who no longer need to convert to WebMGA's previous application specific json-based format.

Periodic repetition settings are now included which allow for visualisation of a larger segment of a bulk liquid which has been simplified using periodic boundary conditions.

A distance-based variable level of detail optimisation has been included which allows for more responsive visualisation of very large configurations with high geometry quality settings with minimal perceivable visual degradation.

Various miscellaneous bugfixes were also implemented which should result in a generally improved user experience, particularly regarding UI setting and model synchronisation.

Some bugs and additional useful features which would result in a more polished user experience still persist and are discussed in \cref{future}.
