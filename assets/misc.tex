\section{Miscellaneous Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Various GUI and model state synchronisation issues fixed.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bounding box now updates correctly on new model loading.
    \item Fixed the scene update function to be called immediately before any frame render rather than only on certain camera movements (as part of a bug fix for \cref{axes_positions_sec}).
  \end{itemize}
  \item Outdated and vulnerable dependencies updated.
  \item Fixed various type inconsistencies in code which could result in unexpected behaviour and added additional validation checks.
  \item Changed shape geometry complexity increments (Level of Detail slider) to a base 2 logspace to scale with more sensible intervals.
\end{itemize}
