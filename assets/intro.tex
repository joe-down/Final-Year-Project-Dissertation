WebMGA 3.0 is a visualisation tool for molecular simulation outputs which refines on previous versions by \textcite{Battistini_2021,webmga_2}. It provides a more modern, maintainable, and accessible alternative to the older QMGA tool by \textcite{gabriel2008molecular}. The program is available as a web app at \citeurl{webmga_3_app}, with source code at \citeurl{webmga_3_github}.

This project aimed to fix existing issues in WebMGA and further enhance the existing feature set.
