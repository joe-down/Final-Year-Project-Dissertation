WebMGA 3.0 is a visualisation tool for molecular simulation outputs which refines on previous versions by \textcite{Battistini_2021,webmga_2}. It provides a more modern, maintainable, and accessible alternative to the older QMGA tool by \textcite{gabriel2008molecular}. The program is available as a web app at \citeurl{webmga_3_app}, with source code at \citeurl{webmga_3_github}. Development utilised JavaScript with the React\cite{react} framework and three.js\cite{three} 3D graphics library.This project aimed to fix existing issues in WebMGA and further enhance the existing feature set.

This report provides a background summary explaining the requirements and terminology for molecular simulation rendering (\cref{context_section}), descriptions for the changes required and made for WebMGA 3.0 (\cref{req_section,imp_section}), and quantitative summaries for performance improvements and qualitative analysis of rendered systems (\cref{analysis_sec}). Finally, achievements are summarised and the project successes evaluated (\cref{conc_eval_sec}).
