WebMGA 3.0 is a web-based visualisation tool for molecular simulation outputs which refines on previous versions by Eduardo Battistini (2021) and Yue He (2023). It can be used to produce 3D renders, utilising a range of geometries, for representation of molecule configurations. WebMGA was first developed to replace the older QMGA tool, which  has remained unmaintained since 2009 and is difficult to install on modern systems, providing extended features over this older program.

This project aimed to fix existing issues in WebMGA and further enhance the existing feature set. Most effort was focused on implementing additional molecule geometries and optimising existing geometries, improving visualisation for the axes and director, visualising periodic repetitions of a configuration, and implementing a distance based variable level of detail performance optimisation.
