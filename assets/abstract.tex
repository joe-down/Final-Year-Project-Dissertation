WebMGA 3.0 is a visualisation tool for molecular simulation outputs which refines on previous versions by \textcite{Battistini_2021,webmga_2}, intended to replace the older QMGA tool. This project aimed to fix existing issues in WebMGA and further enhance the existing feature set. Most effort was focused on implementing additional molecule geometries and optimising existing geometries, improving visualisation for the axes and director, visualising periodic repetitions of a configuration, and implementing a distance based variable Level of Detail performance optimisation.
